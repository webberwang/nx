# affected:build

Build applications and publishable libraries affected by changes

## Usage

```bash
nx affected:build
```

Install `nx` globally to invoke the command directly using `nx`, or use `npm run nx` or `yarn nx`.

### Examples

Run build in parallel:

```bash
nx affected:build --parallel --maxParallel=5
```

Rerun the build target only for the projects that failed last time:

```bash
nx affected:build --only-failed
```

Run the build target for all projects:

```bash
nx affected:build --all
```

Run the build target for the affected projects and also all the projects the affected projects depend on.:

```bash
nx affected:build --with-deps
```

Run build for all the projects affected by changing the index.ts file:

```bash
nx affected:build --files=libs/mylib/src/index.ts
```

Run build for all the projects affected by the changes between master and HEAD (e.g., PR):

```bash
nx affected:build --base=master --head=HEAD
```

Run build for all the projects affected by the last commit on master:

```bash
nx affected:build --base=master~1 --head=master
```

Run build for all the projects affected by the last commit on master and their dependencies:

```bash
nx affected:build --base=master~1 --head=master --with-deps
```
