# affected

Run task for affected projects

## Usage

```bash
nx affected
```

Install `nx` globally to invoke the command directly using `nx`, or use `npm run nx` or `yarn nx`.

### Examples

Run custom target for all affected projects:

```bash
nx affected --target=custom-target
```

Run tests in parallel:

```bash
nx affected --target=test --parallel --maxParallel=5
```

Rerun the test target only for the projects that failed last time:

```bash
nx affected --target=test --only-failed
```

Run the test target for all projects:

```bash
nx affected --target=test --all
```

Run the test target for the affected projects and also all the projects the affected projects depend on.:

```bash
nx affected --target=test --with-deps
```

Run tests for all the projects affected by changing the index.ts file:

```bash
nx affected --target=test --files=libs/mylib/src/index.ts
```

Run tests for all the projects affected by the changes between master and HEAD (e.g., PR):

```bash
nx affected --target=test --base=master --head=HEAD
```

Run tests for all the projects affected by the last commit on master:

```bash
nx affected --target=test --base=master~1 --head=master
```

Run build for all the projects affected by the last commit on master and their dependencies:

```bash
nx affected --target=build --base=master~1 --head=master --with-deps
```
