# affected:lint

Lint projects affected by changes

## Usage

```bash
nx affected:lint
```

Install `nx` globally to invoke the command directly using `nx`, or use `npm run nx` or `yarn nx`.

### Examples

Run lint in parallel:

```bash
nx affected:lint --parallel --maxParallel=5
```

Rerun the lint target only for the projects that failed last time:

```bash
nx affected:lint --only-failed
```

Run the lint target for all projects:

```bash
nx affected:lint --all
```

Run lint for all the projects affected by changing the index.ts file:

```bash
nx affected:lint --files=libs/mylib/src/index.ts
```

Run lint for all the projects affected by the changes between master and HEAD (e.g., PR):

```bash
nx affected:lint --base=master --head=HEAD
```

Run lint for all the projects affected by the last commit on master:

```bash
nx affected:lint --base=master~1 --head=master
```
