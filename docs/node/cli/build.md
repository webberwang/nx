# build

Compiles an application into an output directory named dist/ at the given output path. Must be executed from within a workspace directory.

## Usage

The `build` command is a built-in alias to the [run command](/{{framework}}/cli/run).

These two commands are equivalent:

```bash
nx build <project> [options]
```

```bash
nx run <project>:build [options]
```

Install the `nx` package globally to invoke the command directly using `nx`, or use `npm run nx` or `yarn nx`.

### Examples

Compile a `production` build of the `myapp` project:

```bash
nx build myapp --prod
```
