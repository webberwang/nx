# e2e

Builds and serves an app, then runs end-to-end tests using the configured E2E test runner.

## Usage

The `e2e` command is a built-in alias to the [run command](/{{framework}}/cli/run).

These two commands are equivalent:

```bash
nx e2e <project>
```

```bash
nx run <project>:e2e
```

Install the `nx` package globally to invoke the command directly using `nx`, or use `npm run nx` or `yarn nx`.

### Examples

Run E2E test with a custom base url:

```bash
nx e2e myapp-e2e --base-url http://localhost:4201
```

Run E2E test with a specific target:

```bash
nx e2e myapp-e2e --configuration smoke
```

Run E2E test in watch mode:

```bash
nx e2e myapp-e2e --watch
```

## Common Options

The options below are common to the E2E commands used within an Nx workspace. Cypress and Protractor-specifc options are listed below.

### baseUrl

Use this to pass directly the address of your distant server address with the port running your application.

### configuration (-c)

A named build target, as specified in the "configurations" section of angular.json. Each named target is accompanied by a configuration of option defaults for that target. Setting this explicitly overrides the `--prod` option.

### devServerTarget

Dev server target to run tests against.

### prod

Shorthand for `--configuration=production`. When true, sets the build configuration to the production target. By default, the production target is set up in the workspace configuration such that all builds make use of bundling, limited tree-shaking, and also limited dead code elimination.

### version

Show version number

### watch

Open the Cypress test runner & autmatically run tests when files are updated

## Cypress Options

### browser

The browser to run tests in.

### ci-build-id

A unique identifier for a run to enable grouping or parallelization.

### ci-build-id

### exit

Whether or not the Cypress Test Runner will stay open after running tests in a spec file

### group

### help

### key

### parallel
